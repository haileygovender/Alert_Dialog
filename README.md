# ⚠️ AlertDialog Android App (Kotlin)

This is a simple Android application that demonstrates how to implement an **AlertDialog** in Kotlin. When the user clicks a button, a confirmation dialog is shown asking whether they want to uninstall an app (e.g., Facebook). A `Toast` message follows the user's decision.

## 🎯 Features

- Displays a custom `AlertDialog` when a button is clicked  
- Handles both **Yes** and **No** responses  
- Shows a `Toast` message based on the user’s selection  

## 📱 Preview

**Dialog Prompt:**  
Do you want to uninstall Facebook?

✅ Clicking **Yes**:  
`Toast: App has been successfully uninstalled`

❌ Clicking **No**:  
The dialog simply closes

## 🧱 Built With

- Kotlin  
- Android SDK  
- Android Studio  

## 🧪 How It Works

1. A button (`btnAlert`) is defined in the `activity_main.xml`.  
2. When the button is clicked, it triggers the `showAlertDialog()` method.  
3. An `AlertDialog.Builder` sets up the title, message, and button actions.  
4. Based on the user's choice, appropriate actions (like showing a `Toast` or dismissing the dialog) are performed.
